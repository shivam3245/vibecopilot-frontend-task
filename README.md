I have completed the frontend task as required. Below is a summary of the implementation:


Login and Register Page:

Utilized Redux to manage user data. The login process checks the Redux store to validate the user, and upon successful login, the user is redirected to the home page.
Implemented protected routing to ensure only logged-in users can access other pages. After logging in, the navigation links in the navbar become visible.


Home Page:

On page load, I used Axios to call a fake API and display the fetched data on the Home page.


Navbar and Sidebar:

Designed the Navbar for larger screens (laptop/desktop) and a Sidebar for smaller screens (phone/tablet), ensuring responsiveness.


Page Creation:

Created five pages: Home, About, Contact, Services, and Industries.


Form Page:

Developed a Form Page that captures and displays submitted data on a separate page(Form Data).
